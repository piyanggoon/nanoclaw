description: Run initial NanoClaw setup. Use when user wants to install dependencies, authenticate WhatsApp, register their main channel, or start the background services. Triggers on "setup", "install", "configure nanoclaw", or first-time setup requests.
---

# NanoClaw Setup

Run all commands automatically. Only pause when user action is required (scanning QR codes).

## 1. Install Host Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Build Agent Runner

The agent runner is a separate TypeScript project that executes Claude Agent SDK as a subprocess.

```bash
cd container/agent-runner
npm install
npx tsc
```

Verify the build produced output:

```bash
ls container/agent-runner/dist/index.js && echo "Agent runner built successfully" || echo "BUILD FAILED"
```

## 3. Configure Claude Authentication

Ask the user:
> Do you want to use your **Claude subscription** (Pro/Max) or an **Anthropic API key**?

### Option 1: Claude Subscription (Recommended)

Ask the user:
> Want me to grab the OAuth token from your current Claude session?

If yes:
```bash
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.claude/.credentials.json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.claudeAiOauth.accessToken // empty')
if [ -n "$TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=$TOKEN" > .env
  echo "Token configured: ${TOKEN:0:20}...${TOKEN: -4}"
else
  echo "No token found - are you logged in to Claude Code?"
fi
```

If the token wasn't found, tell the user:
> Run `claude` in another terminal and log in first, then come back here.

### Option 2: API Key

Ask if they have an existing key to copy or need to create one.

**Copy existing:**
```bash
grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" /path/to/source/.env > .env
```

**Create new:**
```bash
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=' > .env
```

Tell the user to add their key from https://console.anthropic.com/

**Verify:**
```bash
KEY=$(grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env | cut -d= -f2)
[ -n "$KEY" ] && echo "API key configured: ${KEY:0:10}...${KEY: -4}" || echo "Missing"
```

## 4. WhatsApp Authentication

**USER ACTION REQUIRED**

Run the authentication script:

```bash
npm run auth
```

Tell the user:
> A QR code will appear. On your phone:
> 1. Open WhatsApp
> 2. Tap **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
> 3. Scan the QR code

Wait for the script to output "Successfully authenticated" then continue.

If it says "Already authenticated", skip to the next step.

## 5. Configure Assistant Name

Ask the user:
> What trigger word do you want to use? (default: `Andy`)
>
> Messages starting with `@TriggerWord` will be sent to Claude.

If they choose something other than `Andy`, update it in these places:
1. `groups/CLAUDE.md` - Change "# Andy" and "You are Andy" to the new name
2. `groups/main/CLAUDE.md` - Same changes at the top
3. `data/registered_groups.json` - Use `@NewName` as the trigger when registering groups

Store their choice - you'll use it when creating the registered_groups.json and when telling them how to test.

## 6. Register Main Channel

Ask the user:
> Do you want to use your **personal chat** (message yourself) or a **WhatsApp group** as your main control channel?

For personal chat:
> Send any message to yourself in WhatsApp (the "Message Yourself" chat). Tell me when done.

For group:
> Send any message in the WhatsApp group you want to use as your main channel. Tell me when done.

After user confirms, start the app briefly to capture the message:

```bash
timeout 10 npm run dev || true
```

Then find the JID from the database:

```bash
# For personal chat (ends with @s.whatsapp.net)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@s.whatsapp.net' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"

# For group (ends with @g.us)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@g.us' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"
```

Create/update `data/registered_groups.json` using the JID from above and the assistant name from step 5:
```json
{
  "JID_HERE": {
    "name": "main",
    "folder": "main",
    "trigger": "@ASSISTANT_NAME",
    "added_at": "CURRENT_ISO_TIMESTAMP"
  }
}
```

Ensure the groups folder exists:
```bash
mkdir -p groups/main/logs
```

## 7. Build & Configure launchd Service

Build the host TypeScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

Generate the plist file with correct paths:

```bash
NODE_PATH=$(which node)
PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd)
HOME_PATH=$HOME

mkdir -p logs

cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.nanoclaw</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>${NODE_PATH}</string>
        <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/dist/index.js</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:${HOME_PATH}/.local/bin</string>
        <key>HOME</key>
        <string>${HOME_PATH}</string>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/logs/nanoclaw.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/logs/nanoclaw.error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

echo "Created launchd plist with:"
echo "  Node: ${NODE_PATH}"
echo "  Project: ${PROJECT_PATH}"
```

Start the service:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
launchctl list | grep nanoclaw
```

## 8. Test

Tell the user (using the assistant name they configured):
> Send `@ASSISTANT_NAME hello` in your registered chat.

Check the logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

The user should receive a response in WhatsApp.

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting**: Check `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`

**Agent fails with "Claude Code process exited with code 1"**:
- Check agent logs: `cat groups/main/logs/agent-*.log | tail -50`
- Ensure `.env` file has valid `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**No response to messages**:
- Verify the trigger pattern matches (e.g., `@AssistantName` at start of message)
- Check that the chat JID is in `data/registered_groups.json`
- Check `logs/nanoclaw.log` for errors

**Agent runner not found**:
- Ensure agent runner is built: `ls container/agent-runner/dist/index.js`
- If missing, rebuild: `cd container/agent-runner && npm install && npx tsc`

**WhatsApp disconnected**:
- The service will show a macOS notification
- Run `npm run auth` to re-authenticate
- Restart the service: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw`

**Unload service**:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```
